# Design Patterns in C#

This project aims to study and implement the most commonly used design patterns in software development. By demonstrating the usage of these patterns through practical examples, the goal is to enhance understanding and provide best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## ðŸ“š Overview
Design patterns are essential tools that help developers solve common problems in software design. These patterns represent proven solutions to recurring design challenges and improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.

In this project, we will explore and implement the following design patterns:

### Creational Patterns:

- Singleton
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
### Structural Patterns:

- Adapter
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns:

- Strategy
- Observer
- Command
- Iterator
- State
- Chain of Responsibility
- Mediator
- Memento
- Visitor

Each pattern is implemented with a C# example demonstrating its real-world application.
